# Day 5: Bring Your Own Data

## Building your own reproducible workflow and analysis, using your own data
Suggested 

- Interrogating your data
    - look carefully at your data and make sure you understand it
    - Write your own version of the metadata
    - create a data management plan
    
- Exploring and wrangling your data
    - Bring your data into R
    - Use R to "fix" inconsistencies or flaws in the data, or reformat the data to be "tidy" for analysis
    - Calculate additional fields based on existing data (if applicable)
    - Create new summary tables based on your raw data
    - look at summary statistics for your main fields of interest, and to look for problematic outliers (e.g. min, max, average, range, summary, etc.)
    - make some basic visualizations to understand your data (distribution, scatterplot with trend line, timeseries, etc.)

- Choosing an analysis
    - do you have quantitative or qualitative data?
    - are parametric or non parametric statistics needed?
    - what kind of question are you trying to answer? (e.g. comparison, relationship, distribution, etc.)
    - will you analyze the raw data, or do you need to filter, summarize, or aggregate your original dataset?

- Visualizing and communicating your data and your analysis
    - What is the most interesting result you found? What kind of plot would best highlight that?
    - Polish your plots to make good use of color, size, shape, and/or labels
    - Experiment with some more advanced plotting techniques
    - Can you translate your R script into an Rmd Report that helps your collaborator/supervisor/reviewer fully understand what you did and how you reached your answer?

- Reading and editing other people's code
    - Swap code and datasets with another person
    - Without guidance, can you understand what the data is about by reading their metadata and/or data management plan?
    - Without guidance, can you understand the code? Do you have any suggestions for them, to help better annotate it, to simplify it, or to follow clearer style guidelines?
    - Take turns discussing or reading aloud each other's code, and inserting edits or suggestions where you agree on them. 
    - (advanced, optional) Push your code and data up to GitHub (if it is OK to be public!) and file suggestions as "issues" or "pull requests"

- Sharing your battle scars and victories
    - Take turns presenting to the whole group what you were able to create during the day
    1. What result are you particularly proud of?
    2. What aspect of working through this material on your own was the most difficult or confusing?
    3. Was there a topic covered this week that changed the way you approached your project, compared to how you would have done it last week? Why?
