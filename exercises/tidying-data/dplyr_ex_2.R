# Find all flights that
# 
# 1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
# 2. Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

# 4. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
# 5. Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
# 6. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
# 7. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
# 8. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do?
# 9. Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
#   
#  10. How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? 
# What might these rows represent?
