#Let's practice our skills with a real dataset!

### Portal Project Dataset 2.0
Now that we've thought about some general data rules and pitfalls, let's look at another version of the Portal dataset, but let's pull it into R this time.

[Access the Portal Teaching Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459)

#### 1. Tell R where your data are
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
surveys <- read_csv("example_data/surveys.csv")
```


#### 4. Look at the data
```{r}
glimpse(surveys)
```

* how do you feel about the way date is recorded? Why?
* does missing data make the data messy?
* what would be our first steps to cleaning up this data for analysis?
